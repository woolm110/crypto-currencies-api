## Development

Redis is required for caching and a valid connection URL should be set to `REDIS_URL`
environment variable before running the development server. `.env` is loaded on
startup. Make sure that you have `redis` installed and running (`redis-server`)
for local development.

```
yarn
yarn dev
```
